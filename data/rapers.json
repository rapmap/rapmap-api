Troutman was well known for his use of the talk box, a device that is connected to an instrument (frequently a keyboard, but most commonly a guitar) to create different vocal effects. Roger used a custom-made talkbox—the Electro Harmonix \"Golden Throat,\" through a Moog Minimoog and later in his career a Yamaha DX100 FM synthesizer.  As both band leader of Zapp and in his subsequent solo releases, he scored a bevy of funk and R&B hits throughout the 1980s.",

He spent some time in jail after the release of C-N-N's debut album The War Report. When he was released, he and N.O.R.E. recorded their second album The Reunion, but shortly after releasing the album, Capone was sent back to jail.[1] In 2004, he recorded the single \"I Need Speed\", for exclusive use in EA's video game Need for Speed: Underground 2, which was featured on the game's soundtrack. In early 2005, Def Jam Recordings released Capone from his contract while retaining Noreaga, leaving the group's status in disarray. Capone released his debut album titled Pain, Time & Glory in 2005, but it received poor sales. He also appeared on the Ron Artest album My World. Holley is of Haitian descent.[2]",

He achieved his initial popularity primarily over the Internet, distributing his music directly to fans on social media networks rather than relying on traditional record labels. His 2006 demo No es Cuestión de Edades (\"It's not a matter of age\") followed by No Hay Truco (\"There is no Trick [to it]\") in 2007 quickly became underground hits with record-breaking downloads.[citation needed] Porta rose to mainstream popularity with his first studio album En Boca de Tantos (\"Talked About by So Many\"), released in 2008 by Universal Music Group. Trastorno Bipolar (\"Bipolar Disorder\") was released in 2009 but failed to match the success of En Boca de Tantos. Porta separated himself from UMG in August 2011 after mounting disagreements. He released Reset on 7 May 2012 after signing with PIAS Spain. The album was a widespread success with positive public reception. Algo ha Cambiado (\"Something's Changed\") was released on 10 June 2014 in physical format in Spain and digitally worldwide. No Hay Truco remains Porta's most downloaded album.",
